# Inverted Pendulum - ROS Project

This is a **ROS-based simulation** of an inverted pendulum mounted on a cart, a classic control systems problem.  
The goal is to balance the pendulum in the upright position using control strategies like **PID**, while simulating the system in **RViz** and **Gazebo**.
Simulation works perfectly while physical model fail due to ineffecient capacity of Motor.
